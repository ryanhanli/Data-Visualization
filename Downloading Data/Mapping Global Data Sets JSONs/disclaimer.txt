When we talk about locations, we often say the location’s latitude first, followed by the
longitude. This convention probably arose because humans discovered latitude long
before we developed the concept of longitude. However, many geospatial frameworks
list the longitude first and then the latitude, because this corresponds to the (x, y)
convention we use in mathematical representations. The geoJSON format follows the
(longitude, latitude) convention, and if you use a different framework it’s important
to learn what convention that framework follows.
