More About Plotly and the GitHub API
To read more about working with Plotly charts, there are two good places
to start. You can find the Plotly User Guide in Python at https://plot.ly/python
/user-guide/. This resource gives you a better understanding of how Plotly
uses your data to construct a visualization and why it approaches defining
data visualizations in this way.
The python figure reference at https://plot.ly/python/reference/ lists all the settings
you can use to configure Plotly visualizations. All the possible chart
types are listed as well as all the attributes you can set for every configuration
option.
For more about the GitHub API, refer to its documentation at https://
developer.github.com/v3/. Here you’ll learn how to pull a wide variety of specific
information from GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you can work
with your own data as well as the publicly available data for other users’
repositories.
